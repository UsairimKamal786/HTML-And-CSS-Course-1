        <div class="section">
            <h2>Introduction to the Universe</h2>
            <p>The universe is a vast expanse containing billions of galaxies, stars, planets, and other cosmic wonders. We will explore some of its most fascinating features, such as planets, astronauts, black holes, and our very own Moon.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Planets in Our Solar System</h2>
            <p>Our solar system contains eight planets, each with unique characteristics. These planets can be classified into two types: terrestrial planets and gas giants.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="highlight">Mercury:</span> The smallest and closest planet to the Sun.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Venus:</span> Similar in size to Earth, but with a toxic atmosphere.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Earth:</span> The only planet known to support life.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Mars:</span> Known as the "Red Planet," it has surface features similar to both Earth and the Moon.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Jupiter:</span> The largest planet in the solar system, with a famous Great Red Spot.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Saturn:</span> Famous for its stunning rings made of ice and rock particles.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Uranus:</span> An ice giant with a unique sideways rotation.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Neptune:</span> The farthest planet from the Sun, with intense winds.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Astronauts: The Pioneers of Space</h2>
            <p>Astronauts are brave men and women who explore space to advance human knowledge and technology. They conduct experiments and gather data on planets, stars, and other celestial bodies. Some famous astronauts include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="highlight">Neil Armstrong:</span> The first person to walk on the Moon during the Apollo 11 mission.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Yuri Gagarin:</span> The first human to travel into space in 1961 aboard Vostok 1.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Sally Ride:</span> The first American woman in space, who flew aboard the Space Shuttle Challenger in 1983.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Astronauts are vital in helping us understand the universe and push the boundaries of exploration.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Mystery of Black Holes</h2>
            <p>Black holes are regions in space where the gravitational pull is so strong that not even light can escape. They are formed when massive stars collapse under their own gravity. Black holes can vary in size, from small ones that form from dying stars, to supermassive black holes found at the centers of most galaxies.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="highlight">Event Horizon:</span> The boundary around a black hole beyond which nothing can escape.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Singularity:</span> The core of a black hole, where matter is compressed into a point of infinite density.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Hawking Radiation:</span> A theoretical prediction that black holes can emit radiation due to quantum effects.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Although black holes are invisible, their presence can be detected by observing their gravitational effects on nearby objects.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Moon: Our Neighbor</h2>
            <p>The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite, and it plays a significant role in our planet's environment. It is the fifth-largest moon in the solar system and is believed to have formed from debris after a massive collision with a Mars-sized object billions of years ago.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="highlight">Phases of the Moon:</span> The Moon goes through different phases, such as new moon, crescent, full moon, and gibbous, due to its orbit around Earth.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Tidal Forces:</span> The Moon's gravitational pull causes tides on Earth, which impact oceans and marine life.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Moon Landings:</span> Humans first landed on the Moon in 1969 during the Apollo 11 mission, and there are plans for future missions to explore its surface more thoroughly.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Moon continues to be a source of wonder and a destination for further exploration. It also plays a vital role in the scientific understanding of space and Earth.</p>
